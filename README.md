### Project Overview: Mini-RAG
This project is a learning exercise designed to enhance my skills in modern AI technologies. It consists of several key components:

- Vector Database: A custom-built database to store and manage vector embeddings.
- Language Model (LLM): Implementing a language model from scratch to understand and generate human-like text.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Architecture: Developing a RAG system to combine the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models.
- Cloud Deployment: Deploying the entire system on the cloud for scalability and accessibility.

This project is a work in progress and will evolve as I expand my knowledge and capabilities in these areas.

### Vector Database Component

This vector database allows for the following functionalities:
- **Adding Vectors**: Store vectors with associated metadata.
- **Retrieving Vectors**: Access stored vectors by their unique identifiers.
- **Similarity Search**: Perform similarity searches using cosine similarity to find vectors similar to a given query vector.
- **Index Updating**: Maintain and update an index of vector similarities.

More functionalities are in development and will be integrated as the project progresses.
